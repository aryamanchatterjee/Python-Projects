Documentation for creditcardfraud.py:

This script trains a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It begins by loading a dataset that contains labeled transaction data, where each row represents a transaction and includes various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized numerical components. The dataset also contains a binary label called Class that indicates whether a transaction is valid or fraudulent.

The script filters out and calculates the ratio of fraudulent to valid transactions, which is essential because fraud detection is typically a case of imbalanced classification—fraud cases are rare. It then separates the features (inputs) from the target labels and splits the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80/20 ratio. This ensures the model is evaluated on data it hasn't seen during training.

The model used is a Random Forest classifier, which is a popular ensemble learning method based on decision trees. After training the model on the training data, it makes predictions on the test set. The script evaluates the model using multiple metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient, which give a balanced view of performance, especially in imbalanced datasets. It also generates a confusion matrix to visually understand how many fraudulent transactions were correctly or incorrectly classified.

Finally, the trained model is saved to disk using the joblib library so it can be reused later without retraining.

Documentation for predict_from_csv.py:

This script is designed to use the previously trained and saved fraud detection model to make predictions on a new set of transactions. It begins by loading the trained model from the pickle file created by the training script. It then reads a new CSV file containing transaction data that must follow the same structure as the original dataset used during training (except the Class column is not required, as the model will predict it).

Once the data is loaded, the model makes predictions for each transaction, determining whether it's likely to be valid or fraudulent. The results are appended as a new column in the dataset. This enhanced dataset is then saved as a new CSV file, allowing the user to inspect which transactions were flagged as frauds.

This script is useful for batch-processing new transactions through the model, enabling automated fraud detection without retraining the model every time.

About the Pickle File and the Excel Files
The fraud_model.pkl file is a serialized version of the trained Random Forest model. It's created using the joblib library, which is optimized for saving large machine learning models efficiently. This file acts as a snapshot of the model’s state after training—it captures all the learned patterns and configurations, allowing it to be reloaded later without needing to retrain on the original dataset. This is crucial for deploying the model in a production-like scenario where you want to make predictions repeatedly on new data without repeating the training process.

There are two key CSV (Excel-compatible) files used in this setup:
1. creditcard.csv – This is the original dataset used to train the model. It contains historical credit card transaction data with features like Time, Amount, and anonymized variables V1 through V28, along with the Class label, where 1 indicates fraud and 0 indicates a valid transaction. This file is used only once during training.
2. new_transactions.csv – This is the input file for future or real-time predictions. It follows the same structure as the training dataset but doesn't include the Class column, since that’s what the model is meant to predict. Once predictions are made, this file is saved as predicted_output.csv, which contains all the original transaction data along with a new column showing whether each transaction is predicted to be fraudulent or not.

Together, these files and the model provide a full pipeline—from training to deployment—for detecting credit card fraud automatically.
